The path of folder with training audios is set in the preprocessing and feature extraction scripts.

Within this folder, there must be two other folders: "category 1" and "category 2". Or any other desired name
(i.e. "UAV" and "Background").

Within those two folders, the corresponding audios are placed.

This same setup is required with the testing data folder.
